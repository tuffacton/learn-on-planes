# learn-on-planes

I fly for work... a lot! 

Nothing makes a 5 hour flight go by quite as well as learning a valuable skill. Of course, when you're in the air you probably don't have Internet, and if you do it's shoddy at best.

I decided to use my almost decade-long experience with airgapped platforms to create this repo of things you can learn while you're in the air!

## How to

1. Navigate to whatever folder for the thing you want to learn
2. Before you get on the plane, be sure to run any `Prerequisite` instructions to download and use everything you need from the Internet

## Goals

This primarily has 2 goals:
1. To challenge me to really think about how to "containerize" everything so it can not only be 100% airgapped
2. To give you the ability to learn something fun even if you're on a plane, cruise, boat, submarine, whatever!
